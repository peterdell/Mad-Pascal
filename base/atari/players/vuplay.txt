The VUPlayer routine is actually pretty simple for this purpose: 

CheckForTwoToneBit
	ldy #3			; default SKCTL register state
	ldx POKC0		; AUDC1
	cpx #$F0		; is the tune expected to run with Proper Volume Only output?
	bcs NoTwoTone		; if equal or above, this is not used for Two-Tone, don't set it
	txa
	and #$10		; test the Volume Only bit
	beq NoTwoTone		; if it is not set, there is no Two-Tone Filter active
	txa
	eor #$10		; reverse the Volume Only bit
	sta POKC0		; overwrite the AUDC
	ldy #$8B		; set the Two-Tone Filter output
NoTwoTone
	sty POKSKC0		; overwrite the buffered SKCTL byte with the new value
	rts
